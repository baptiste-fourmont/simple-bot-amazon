__# How to use it__


It's a simple bot create in Python 
( Actually only working with chrome but  it's pretty simple to add Firefox ) 
You have just to launch the bot, python3 track.py
Then connect you to the amazon page ( You got 60 secondes ) 
If you want to buy another things on amazon, you have just to create another BOT with the actual constructor

```
xboxseriesx = BOT("https://www.amazon.fr/") 
```
