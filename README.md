__# How to use it__


It's a simple bot create in Python 
( Actually only working with chrome but  it's pretty simple to add Firefox ) 
You have just to launch the bot, python3 track.py
Then connect you to the amazon page ( You got 60 secondes ) 
If you want to buy another things on amazon, you have just to create another BOT with the actual constructor

```
caligraphe = BOT("https://www.amazon.fr/Clairefontaine-108715C-17x22cm-feuilles-Assortis/dp/B07WZNXGGY/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_fr_FR=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=60+centime&qid=1632825045&sr=8-1") PS: only 60 centimes if you wanna try the bot x)
```
